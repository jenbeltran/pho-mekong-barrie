## Preface

#### Using Build Tools

Semantic UI packaged Gulp build tools so your project can preserve its [own theme changes](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html).

The easiest way to install Semantic UI is our NPM package which contains special install scripts to make setup interactive and updates seamless.

For installing with specific integrations like Ember, React, or Meteor, see our [integration guide](https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/integrations.html)

For integrating Semantic UI tasks into your own build tools, or using a CDN see our [recipes](https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/advanced-usage.html) section.
